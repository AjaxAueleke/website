        Q.Write about issues and/or observations that helped you install Java 8.
      </p>
      <p>
        The task only required me to install Java 8 so it was fairly easy. I
        think the reason I found this easy is that I have worked with several
        languages like C, C++, Python, Javascript, and MATLAB so I found the
        installation procedure familiar. The other reason could be that I used
        to play Minecraft which requires you to install Java so I guess that
        made it pretty easy. The only issue I faced initially was that I could
        not understand why I had to use Java SE Development Kit 8, while the 16
        is the latest version but I guess you guys required it for some reason
        so I went with it.

        Q. Write any issues and/or observations that helped you install and
        setup IntelliJ on your computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Installing IntelliJ was also quite easy as I am familiar with other
        JetBrains products so I was aware of the installation and setup process
        and I was able to install and set it up for my tasks in little to no
        time.

        Q.Write any issues and/or observations that helped you use GitHub/
      </p>
      <p>
        Github is a tool that I have been using for over a year. My account has
        around 20+ repositories and I use gh-pages to host my javascript
        projects, so this made it easy for me to use git and GitHub, and I
        didn't even have to make a new account or download git-SCM.
